## Todo:
* Use HTML forms to add new characters to the arena.
* Have buttons that can initiate attacks.
* Take attack input from user each turn.
* Have images to represent characters (incl. stats) and attacks.
* Use CSS to have the arena look like a Gameboy (screen, A button, B button, Start, and numpad).
* Other CSS to prettify HTML.
